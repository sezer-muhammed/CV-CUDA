# NumPy 2 Python packages for the Docker images, builder and devel
# - requirements are installed across Python versions (3.9-3.14)
# - using the same requirements for Manylinux builders, Ubuntu 22.04 and Ubuntu 24.04

# NumPy 2 with version constraints based on Python version and wheel availability
# - Python 3.9: Limited to numpy 2.0.2 (last version with py3.9 precompiled wheels on x86_64/aarch64)
# - Python 3.10-3.13: Use numpy 2.2.6 (stable, has wheels for both architectures)
# - Python 3.14: Use latest numpy 2.3.3
numpy==2.0.2; python_version=="3.9"
numpy==2.2.6; python_version>="3.10" and python_version<"3.14"
numpy==2.3.3; python_version=="3.14"
